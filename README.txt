Hey, new (Project) Script in RageUI, however you must be wondering how to use it ?
It's very simple, you just need to call a line that will call this Boss / Employee menu, in any profession

- line : (Call) = RageUI.Visible(RMenu:Get('core', 'stock_entreprise_main'), true)
                  RefreshInfosSociety()

Dependencies such as esx_society, esx_addon_inventory, esx_datastore, esx_addon_account no longer exist!
